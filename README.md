# Diceroller

For large quantities of dice rolls!

This is a simple script to roll a large quantity of a die that have an arbitrary number of sides.
For example,
```
Input X dice with Y sides (XdY): 3d6
Roll 0 is 6
Roll 1 is 5
Roll 2 is 2
Result of rolling 3 dice, with 6 sides each, is: 13
Roll again? (y/n) 
```

The program itself can be easily modified to suit whatever needs, as it is very simple.

Future versions may have more options for different types of dice rolls, perhaps even game specific features.
(ie, advantage from dnd)
